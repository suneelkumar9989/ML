# SMALL INTRO ABOUT THE CHATBOT
- This program is based on simple design of the chatbot.....
1. The bot starts with greeting, self introduction of the bot and ask for the name of the person/user.
2. The bot will greet the person/user based on the time like good morning or good afternoon or good evening based on the time the user using the bot and welcomes the      user/person.
3. Bot will ask the person/user what to do, it will offer a choice of things based upon the bot design.
4. It will respond to user to give input correctly.
